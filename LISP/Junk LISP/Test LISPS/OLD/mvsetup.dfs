;;; MView Setup Defaults
;;; This file contains sets of defaults for setting up multiple viewport
;;; configurations in Paperspace in Release 13 of AutoCAD.  It is intended
;;; that you modify the entries given here to create your own customized
;;; versions.  The format of the file is as follows:
;;;
;;; The first part of the file is a list of the NAME's of the entries
;;; followed by an END_NAMES delimiter.
;;;
;;; Each of the names may have optional, comma delimited fields in the
;;; following order:  the first optional field is the file/path name of
;;; an AutoCAD drawing which is to be inserted at the local UCS origin
;;; when the name is selected, followed by a window in paperspace units
;;; which represents the extents (in paperspace) of the usable paper
;;; area.  This is the area which may be automatically filled with
;;; viewports.  Last is either mm or in which specifies whether the units
;;; used to construct the title block are specified in millimeters or
;;; inches.  If the area points are not specified this filed may follow
;;; the drawing name immediately.
;;;
;;; The data portion of the file for any NAME entry is of arbitrary
;;; length, and contains lines of AutoLISP code with all coordinates
;;; in Paperspace units.  It is terminated with END_DATA.
;;;
;;; Lines of AutoLisp code cannot be split across multiple lines.
;;;
;;; Lines may be commented out with `;'.
